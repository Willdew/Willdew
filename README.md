## Hi there 👋
## ✨ About Me
I am William, a computer science student at the Technical University of Denmark, specializing in Cybersecurity and Embedded Systems. I enjoy optimizing systems, low level programming and figuring out how everything work down to the last bit

🦀 My latest fixation is embedded rust, and the ecosystem evolving around it, and i hope to start contributing to open source embedded rust projects once my rust level reaches a sufficient level.

🎸 In my spare time i play guitar in a metal band, and i enjoy modding and building my own weird guitar pedals, as it is also a very good way to improve my PCB design skills! 

⛰️ Other than this I enjoy hiking and mountaineering (As you might have inferred from my profile picture)

## My Experience
- Embedded programming in C and Rust, especially on STM32 chips
- Pcb design, both analog, mixed signal and digital
- Web programming with C# and Blazor running on WASM
- Test automation of embedded systems with Python
